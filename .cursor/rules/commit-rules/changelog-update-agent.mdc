# Changelog Update Agent

## Purpose

This rule ensures proper documentation of changes in the project's CHANGELOG.md file with every commit you make. Following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format helps maintain a clear and consistent record of project evolution.

## When to Apply

- ALWAYS check if CHANGELOG.md needs updating when preparing to make commits
- ALWAYS include changelog updates in the same commit as code changes
- NEVER make significant code changes without documenting them

## Changelog Entry Guidelines

Each entry should be concise and follow this structure:

### Type of Change

Categorize changes under one of these sections:
- **Added**: New features
- **Changed**: Changes in existing functionality
- **Deprecated**: Soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed**: Removed features
- **Fixed**: Bug fixes
- **Security**: Vulnerability fixes
- **Performance**: Performance improvements
- **Documentation**: Documentation-only changes
- **Build**: Build system or dependency changes
- **CI**: CI configuration changes

### Format Rules

1. Add new entries under the `## [Unreleased]` section
2. Use bullet points (- ) for each change
3. Write in imperative, present tense (e.g., "Add" not "Added")
4. Include issue/PR references where applicable: `(#123)`
5. Group related changes under the same bullet
6. Use sub-bullets for details when necessary

## Example Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with appropriate entry
3. Include both in the same commit
4. Ensure the commit message references the changelog update

## Example Entries

```markdown
### Added
- Add multi-tenant authentication system (#42)
- Implement plugin management interface

### Fixed
- Fix race condition in tenant initialization (#56)
- Correct styling issues in dashboard components
```

## Version Guidelines

When releasing a new version:
1. Change `## [Unreleased]` to `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
2. Add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` section at top
3. Update the diff links at the bottom of the file
