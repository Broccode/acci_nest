# Time-Aware Tavily Research

## Context

- Applied when user requests deep research or information that may be time-sensitive
- Prevents outdated information based on AI's training cutoff
- Ensures research is grounded in current date/time context
- Particularly important for news, current events, market data, or evolving topics

## Critical Rules

- ALWAYS get current system date/time BEFORE conducting research
- ALWAYS use web_search tool for research when Tavily tools are not available
- INCLUDE real system date in all search queries for context
- ADAPT search parameters based on date relevance when possible
- DOCUMENT the current date/time in your response to the user
- NEVER rely on your training data for date-sensitive information
- VERIFY information timeline using the current system date as reference
- AVOID phrases like "as of my training data" or "last I knew" without checking

## Examples

<example>
User: Research the latest developments in AI regulation

// First, get current date
mcp_time_get_current_time(timezone="UTC")
// Result shows 2025-03-15

// Use date-aware web search
web_search({
  search_term: "Latest AI regulation developments as of March 2025",
  explanation: "Researching current AI regulations with time context"
})

AI: Basierend auf meiner Recherche vom 15. MÃ¤rz 2025 sind die neuesten Entwicklungen in der KI-Regulierung...
