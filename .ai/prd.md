## Multi-Tenancy Architecture Details

The multi-tenancy architecture is a critical component of the framework, allowing multiple organizations to use the same application instance while maintaining data isolation. We will implement a hybrid approach that combines the benefits of different multi-tenancy models:

### Tenant Identification and Resolution

- **Tenant Resolution Strategies**:
  - URL-based resolution (subdomain or path parameter)
  - Header-based resolution (`X-Tenant-ID` header)
  - JWT claim-based resolution (embedded in authentication token)
  - Dynamic resolution based on configuration
  
- **Tenant Context Management**:
  - Context propagation through request pipeline
  - AsyncLocalStorage for maintaining tenant context across asynchronous operations
  - Thread-safe tenant context storage for request handling

### Data Isolation Strategies

- **Database-Level Isolation**:
  - **Schema Separation**: Each tenant gets its own schema within a shared database
  - **Connection Management**: Dynamically resolve database connections based on tenant
  - **Query Interceptors**: Automatically apply tenant filters to all database queries
  
- **Application-Level Isolation**:
  - Tenant-aware repositories that automatically scope queries to the current tenant
  - Middleware for validating tenant access to resources
  - Service-layer isolation enforcement

### Multi-Tenancy Implementation Components

```typescript
// Tenant identification interface
interface TenantIdentificationStrategy {
  identifyTenant(request: Request): Promise<string>;
}

// Tenant-aware repository base class
abstract class TenantAwareRepository<T> {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(EntityClass) private repository: Repository<T>,
    @Inject(TENANT_CONTEXT) private tenantContext: TenantContext,
  ) {}
  
  findAll(): Promise<T[]> {
    return this.repository.find({
      where: { tenantId: this.tenantContext.getCurrentTenant() },
    });
  }
  
  // Other repository methods with tenant filtering
}

// Tenant middleware
@Injectable()
export class TenantMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  constructor(
    private tenantResolver: TenantResolver,
    private tenantContext: TenantContext,
  ) {}
  
  async use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const tenantId = await this.tenantResolver.resolveTenant(req);
    this.tenantContext.setCurrentTenant(tenantId);
    next();
  }
}
```

### Cross-Tenant Operations

- **Controlled Access**: Specific endpoints and operations designed for cross-tenant access
- **Super Admin Role**: Special roles with permissions to access multiple tenants
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all cross-tenant operations
- **Data Aggregation**: Special query capabilities for authorized aggregation across tenants

## Plugin System Architecture

The plugin system is designed to provide extensibility without requiring modifications to the core framework. It allows developers to add custom functionality, integrate with external systems, and tailor the framework to specific business needs.

### Plugin System Components

- **Plugin Registry**: Central registry of all installed plugins with metadata
- **Plugin Lifecycle Hooks**: Standardized hooks for initialization, runtime, and shutdown
- **Plugin Configuration Management**: System for managing plugin-specific configurations
- **Plugin Dependency Resolution**: Management of dependencies between plugins

### Plugin Types

1. **Core Extensions**: Enhance or modify core framework functionality
2. **Integration Connectors**: Connect to external systems and services
3. **UI Components**: Extend the user interface with custom components
4. **Workflow Actions**: Custom actions for the workflow engine
5. **Security Enhancements**: Add additional security features or integrations

### Plugin Development and Distribution

- **Plugin SDK**: Development kit with tools and interfaces for building plugins
- **Plugin Packaging**: Standardized format for packaging and distributing plugins
- **Plugin Marketplace**: Centralized repository for discovering and installing plugins
- **Plugin Versioning**: Semantic versioning support for managing plugin compatibility

### Plugin Implementation Example

```typescript
// Plugin interface definition
export interface Plugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
  initialize(app: INestApplication): Promise<void>;
  onShutdown?(): Promise<void>;
}

// Plugin registration system
@Injectable()
export class PluginRegistry {
  private plugins: Map<string, Plugin> = new Map();
  
  registerPlugin(plugin: Plugin): void {
    // Validate plugin, check dependencies
    this.plugins.set(plugin.id, plugin);
  }
  
  getPlugin(id: string): Plugin | undefined {
    return this.plugins.get(id);
  }
  
  getAllPlugins(): Plugin[] {
    return Array.from(this.plugins.values());
  }
  
  async initializePlugins(app: INestApplication): Promise<void> {
    // Initialize plugins in dependency order
    for (const plugin of this.getSortedPlugins()) {
      await plugin.initialize(app);
    }
  }
  
  private getSortedPlugins(): Plugin[] {
    // Sort plugins based on dependencies
    // Implementation omitted for brevity
  }
}

// Example plugin implementation
export class EmailNotificationPlugin implements Plugin {
  id = 'email-notification-plugin';
  name = 'Email Notification Plugin';
  version = '1.0.0';
  dependencies = ['user-management-plugin'];
  
  async initialize(app: INestApplication): Promise<void> {
    // Register providers, controllers, etc.
    const moduleRef = app.get(ModuleRef);
    const userService = moduleRef.get(UserService);
    
    // Add notification handlers
    // Set up email templates
    // Configure email delivery
  }
  
  async onShutdown(): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up resources
  }
}
```

## Workflow Engine Architecture

The workflow engine enables the creation of complex business processes with customizable steps, conditions, and actions. It provides a visual editor for designing workflows and an execution engine for running them.

### Workflow Components

- **Workflow Definitions**: JSON-based definitions of workflows and their steps
- **Workflow Engine**: Core system for executing workflow definitions
- **Workflow Designer**: Visual interface for creating and editing workflows
- **Workflow Runtime**: Execution environment for workflow instances
- **Workflow Storage**: Persistence layer for workflow definitions and instances

### Workflow Features

1. **Visual Design**: Drag-and-drop interface for designing workflows
2. **Conditional Branching**: Decision nodes for dynamic process flows
3. **Parallel Execution**: Support for parallel task execution
4. **Human Tasks**: Tasks requiring human approval or input
5. **Integration Actions**: Pre-built actions for system integrations
6. **Custom Extensions**: Plugin system for custom workflow actions
7. **Versioning**: Support for workflow versioning and migration
8. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of workflow execution

### Workflow Definition Example

## Security Architecture

Security is a foundational aspect of the framework, implementing a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of protection. The security architecture addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, and compliance requirements.

### Authentication Architecture

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for various authentication factors
  - Knowledge factors (passwords, PINs)
  - Possession factors (OTP devices, SMS, email)
  - Inherence factors (biometric integration)
  
- **Identity Provider Integration**:
  - OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect support
  - SAML 2.0 support for enterprise SSO
  - Social login providers (configurable)
  - Custom identity provider integration

- **Token Management**:
  - JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
  - Refresh token rotation for enhanced security
  - Token revocation capabilities
  - Configurable token expiration policies

### Authorization Framework

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Hierarchical role structure
  - Fine-grained permission system
  - Role inheritance
  - Dynamic role assignment

- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
  - Policy-based authorization decisions
  - Context-aware access control
  - Dynamic permission evaluation

- **Multi-Level Authorization**:
  - Resource-level permissions
  - Field-level security
  - Operation-level authorization
  - Data-driven access control

### Data Protection

- **Encryption Solutions**:
  - Transport-level encryption (TLS)
  - Database-level encryption
  - Field-level encryption for sensitive data
  - Key management system

- **Data Access Controls**:
  - Row-level security
  - Column-level security
  - Dynamic data masking
  - Secure audit logging

### Security Implementation Components

```typescript
// Permission decorator for securing endpoints
export function RequirePermission(permission: string) {
  return applyDecorators(
    SetMetadata(PERMISSION_KEY, permission),
    UseGuards(PermissionGuard),
  );
}

// Permission guard implementation
@Injectable()
export class PermissionGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(
    private reflector: Reflector,
    private permissionService: PermissionService,
    private tenantContext: TenantContext,
  ) {}
  
  async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const requiredPermission = this.reflector.get<string>(
      PERMISSION_KEY,
      context.getHandler(),
    );
    
    if (!requiredPermission) {
      return true;
    }
    
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    const tenantId = this.tenantContext.getCurrentTenant();
    
    return this.permissionService.hasPermission(
      user.id,
      requiredPermission,
      tenantId,
    );
  }
}

// Field-level encryption service
@Injectable()
export class EncryptionService {
  constructor(
    private configService: ConfigService,
    private keyManagementService: KeyManagementService,
  ) {}
  
  async encryptField(data: string, context: EncryptionContext): Promise<string> {
    const key = await this.keyManagementService.getKey(context);
    // Encryption implementation
    return encryptedData;
  }
  
  async decryptField(data: string, context: EncryptionContext): Promise<string> {
    const key = await this.keyManagementService.getKey(context);
    // Decryption implementation
    return decryptedData;
  }
}
```
