# ACCI Nest Security Documentation

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the ACCI Nest Enterprise Application Framework and demonstrates compliance with OWASP Top 10 and SOC2 requirements.

## Security Compliance Overview

ACCI Nest follows a comprehensive security approach that integrates security into every aspect of the development lifecycle. This document serves as evidence of our security practices and compliance efforts.

## Security Testing Evidence

Security testing is integrated into our development process to ensure controls are effective. Evidence of security testing includes:

1. Unit tests that verify individual security control implementations
2. Integration tests that validate security controls in combination
3. Security-focused static code analysis
4. Dependency vulnerability scanning
5. Penetration testing for the overall system
